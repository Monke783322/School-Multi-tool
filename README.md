# School-Multi-tool - By TVEGesd
Hello and thank you for finding this
I hope you like this I am currently going to learn how to code this is Python so everyone can use it
But currently at the moment this only works for windows.
# How to use
The way to use it is to download the MultiTool by clicking the green Code button and click download as zip,
and after that extract the file from it and drag it to your desktop or just put it anywhere I don't own your PC lol,
and after extracting the file run the program and it is good.
# Thank you
Thank you for using this tool it may have taken me a few minutes to code this,
yet I will love to hear your ideas
if there are any Issues make sure to report them to me and I will fix them when I get the chance.
# BTW THIS IS OPEN SOURCE I DON'T CARE IF IT GETS SKIDDED
