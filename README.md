Hello and thank you for finding this, and I hope you use it
# How to use Batch - this only works for windows I think maybe
The way to use it is to download the MultiTool by clicking the green Code button and click download as zip,
and after that extract the file from it and drag it to your desktop or just put it anywhere I don't own your PC lol,
and after extracting the file run the program and it is good.
# How to use Python
To use the python program I recomend like VS code if you have access to it, but if your on a school computer or something use replit (Links are bellow)
Copy the code from School-Multitool.py and paste it into the program that you are using and just run it and your good!
